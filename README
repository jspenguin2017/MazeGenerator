Description:

Maze Generator is a mini-game about random mazes. It can not only generate and
solve random mazes but also allow a human player to challenge them. You will be
greeted by hostile enemies that charge towards you. Be smart and use the
terrain to your advantage. Further you are from the enemies, safer you are.


Quick Start:

After extracting all the files, simply run "python3 start.py" to start the
server. You can then go to "http://localhost:8000/" using a modern browser and
you can start playing the game. Note that you may need to click on the canvas
for Firefox to start accepting keyboard inputs, it is not a problem on
Chromium. You can install Chromium by running:
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install chromium-browser


Help:

The three buttons on the bottom creates a new maze, solves the current maze,
and enters player mode respectively. You cannot use the solve functionality
in player mode and you cannot enter player mode on an already solved maze.

You are the orange box, your goal is to reach the green box while avoiding
red boxes. Use the arrow keys to move your character.
